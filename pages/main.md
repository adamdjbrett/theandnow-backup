This is a great saga, rescued from the depths of recent history. While it took a decade to put this Humpty-Dumpty back together again, its lessons are now yours to discover  

At the crossroads where Americas _first_ Gilded Age joins Englands Victorian Era, Irishman John George Adair meets his widowed American bride, Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie. Theirs becomes the eras first transatlantic marriage. Together they blaze a fateful trail across three continents, leaving a wake of dispossession whose impact is still felt today. From the American Revolution onwards, and peaking from 1861 to 1885, the Adairs, their forbearers and cohorts, uproot entire communities of indigenous people  Irish and Native American  from their ancestral homelands.

Facing an untamed continent, this brilliant duo does anything necessary to maintain their birth right  a lavish Victorian lifestyle  wherever they see fit. Beyond their salons in England and castle in Ireland, they boldly launch the _real_ Bonanza  the first cattle empire of the Texas Panhandle  becoming the largest landowners of their time.

Today, as the Anglosphere embarks on its _second_ Gilded Age, these fateful lessons are more important than ever What will you find?
